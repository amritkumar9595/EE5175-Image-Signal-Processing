# LAB -1 :Geometric Transforms, Occlusion detection

## Geometric Transforms :
* ### Translation
* ### Rotation
* ### Scaling

## Occlusion detection :
* ### aerial images of an airport parking bay
* ### images were captured using two cameras placed at different locations and different instants of time
* ### images are related by an in-plane rotation and translation
* ### need to determine the changes in IMG2 with respect to IMG1.

* ### *Solution*:  **Bilinear Interpolation during target-to-source mapping**.
